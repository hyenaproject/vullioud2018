Description: This R package aims at documenting the workflow behind the results from the 
    paper entitled "Social support drives female dominance in the spotted hyena" 
    by Colin Vullioud, Eve Davidian, Bettina Wachter, François Rousset, 
    Alexandre Courtiol and Oliver P. Höner (submitted). The main goal of the 
    package is to fit GLMM models on interactions data with varying 
    focal individuals (for more details see the method section of the article). 
    This package has not been conceived for general use. It serves to document 
    the steps of our analysis.
