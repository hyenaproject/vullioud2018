# Vullioud_2018

This is the GitHub repository that will host soon the R package Vullioud_2018.
After being uploaded here, the package will not evolve much because it aims at documenting how we obtained the
results for the paper entitled "Social support drives female dominance in the spotted hyena" by Colin Vullioud,
Eve Davidian, Bettina Wachter, François Rousset, Alexandre Courtiol & Oliver P. Höner (in review).
The only planned updates are those that will be necessary to maintain
compatibility with other packages, so that our code won't break.

This package has not been conceived for general use. It serves to document the
steps of our analysis.


## How to explore the sources of the package?

To see our source code, you can either browse the files above within GitHub or 
download the *.tar.gz file containing all sources bundled with some data to 
try out our functions in R.
